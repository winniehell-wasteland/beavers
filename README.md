# Battle Beavers
This project is unmaintained.

## Building
You need to checkout the submodules AndEngine and ibrdtn-api.

## Running
Just put the app.apk on your device (e.g. using Eclipse)

## Gameplay
Soldiers can be selected by long click/touch. Afterwards long clicks set new waypoints, which can be selected as well. The context menu of a waypoint includes all the special actions (aiming, waiting, ignoring enemies) and the option to remove it.
